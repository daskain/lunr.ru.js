# lunr.ru

This is a _very_ early implementation of a Russian language extension for lunr.

It includes a stemmer and a stop word list specific to Russian.

Currently this requires a patched version of lunr to work, see index.html for an example (you need to interact with the index from the browser console.)

##Â TODO

* Some tests.
* A trimmer specific to russian (this is what has been removed from the patched lunr.tokenizer)
* Some sanity tests from a Russian speaker
